## Entry 2025/07/25 13:24 CI/CD Github actions design

I want to design the ci/cd flow with github actions fully now, I think that since i've got a few different sections of code I need to deploy I should have a few different github action definitions? 

So in this case: 

- infrastructure linting, formatting, planning (not running, I would like that to be manually triggered)
- frontend code checks and deployment to S3
- lambda code checks and deployment

to the different segments I think the best way to deploy this code is to trigger the different workflows only when those parts of the code have changed. I am thinking about how errors may occur with the deployment of frontend and lambda code, if the terraform had not run, or if the environment was misconfigured. To combat this, I would like to potentially run the frontend and lambda actions and ensure they are dependant on the terraform actions running. I don't know if this means that can still define three seperate actions files or if I will have to define a single workflow file.
