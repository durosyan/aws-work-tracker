## AWS Zero Hours Tracker

I have a zero hour contract with an activity centre. This means I get to work with no set time schedule.

A bit annoying for prediction of the monthly payment.

I'm creating this tool to demonstrate that I can orchestrate a tool and develop it from start to finish, and because it might actually be useful for prediction of payments.

I will admit this is an overkill solution for this problem, but it helps me learn these different things.
