Honestly, the amount of information on this is alot, I've got the jist of the whole thing, but the details are elusive, I'm trying to verify what I can;

## Manually checking OIDC fingerprint

```bash
openssl s_client -servername token.actions.githubusercontent.com -connect token.actions.githubusercontent.com:443 < /dev/null 2> /dev/null \
  | openssl x509 -fingerprint -noout \
  | cut -d '=' -f 2 \
  | tr -d ':' \
  | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'
```

## ðŸ”„ How the Authentication Flow Works

Hereâ€™s a simplified breakdown of how GitHub Actions authenticates with AWS using OIDC:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[GitHub Action starts] --> B[OIDC Token Requested]
  B --> C[GitHub OIDC Provider issues JWT]
  C --> D[JWT includes claims: sub, aud, iss]
  D --> E[AWS IAM Role Trust Policy checks JWT]
  E --> F[Thumbprint of GitHub TLS cert (SHA-1) validated]
  F --> G[GitHub Action assumes IAM Role via sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity]
  G --> H[Temporary AWS credentials issued]
  H --> I[Terraform Plan executed with AWS access]
```

## ðŸ§  Summary of Key Steps

- **GitHub** generates a short-lived **JWT** via its OIDC provider (`token.actions.githubusercontent.com`)
- The JWT includes claims like `sub` (subject), which must match the trust policy in AWS
- AWS uses the **SHA-1 thumbprint** to verify GitHubâ€™s TLS certificate
- If everything checks out, AWS issues temporary credentials to the GitHub Action
